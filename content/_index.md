## Quality websites for small businesses and creative individuals. 

Creators, small businesses, and non-profits have a lot to manage. We build simple, unique sites with an easy update process and low maintainance costs, so you can focus on your priorities.

#### Our Values:

- The web allows strangers to write down everything people do online. People’s data should be their own, and our sites are built to respect privacy.
- The most beautiful part of the web is that anyone can use it. We follow standards like the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines to make sure that's true.
- Websites are meant to be seen and shared. We help plan carefully to present your site to the audiences who matter.

#### Pricing:

Well prepared clients will get a website for $700.
